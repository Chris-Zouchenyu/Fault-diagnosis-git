# Fault-diagnosis-git
Using three models to classfy the FAULT
The dataset comes from the experimental data of rolling bearings at Western Reserve University.  
  
We do not introduce too much about the dataset because it is been well known by most researcher.  
This is a simple classification of the dataset:

In this project,I use three models for classifying the dataset(Ten classification).  

The result are over here
Accuracy:  
### CNN: 0.93  
### MLP: 0.88  
### RES: 0.92
